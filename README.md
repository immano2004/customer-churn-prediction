## 📌 Overview
Customer churn directly impacts business revenue.  
This project builds an end-to-end Machine Learning system that predicts whether a customer is likely to leave a telecom service.

The solution helps businesses identify at-risk customers early and take proactive retention actions.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
Reduce customer loss by:
- Predicting churn probability
- Identifying high-risk customers
- Supporting data-driven retention strategies

---

## 🧠 Solution Pipeline

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Training & Evaluation  
5. Model Selection  
6. Streamlit Web App Deployment
