# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Overview
This project predicts customer churn using supervised machine learning to help businesses identify customers who are likely to leave and take preventive actions. The system analyzes customer behavior, service usage, and billing patterns to generate churn predictions with high accuracy.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Customer churn directly impacts company revenue. The goal is to build a predictive model that identifies at-risk customers early so retention strategies can be applied.
